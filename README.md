Concordance of genetic information to increase confidence in biomarkers


Project title: 
### Enhanced Confidence for HER2 Status Predictions in Breast Cancer using Different Genomic Profiles

Abstract: 
Decision in precision oncology are driven by extensive testing for many biomark-
ers. In breast cancer, HER2 is a well established biomarker that is traditionally
tested for by immunohistochemistry (IHC). More recently, next-generation se-
quencing (NGS) has become widely used in tumor diagnostics. However, inte-
grating the different data modalities from NGS such as the total copy number,
allele-specific copy numbers and gene expression into current clinical practice
is a difficult task. Here we investigated the HER2 status concordance between
different NGS data modalities with IHC in a breast cancer cohort (n = 687)
and applied the learning to a immuno-oncology (IO) cohort (n = 44). An accu-
racy of 96.07% was obtained by predicting every samples with a ERBB2 total
copy number higher or equal to 7 as positive. Integrating the gene expression
as well lead to an accuracy of 96.36%. Logistic regression (LR) and random
forest (RF) with the allele-specific copy numbers or all data modalities did re-
sult in very similar accuracies, though not improving the simple threshold-
ing approach. The thresholding approach was also minimally successful in a
immuno-oncology cohort of 44 samples, where predicting samples with 2 or
more total gene copies for CD274 as responders lead to a 70% accuracy. How-
ever, the IO cohort was extremely limited in size. Our results confirmed the
very high concordance between ERBB2 amplification in breast cancer and the
HER2 status by IHC. Using an integrative approach was not seen as to be used
in a stand-alone manner in the future, but rather as a complimentary tool to
traditional testing.
